            <p align="justify"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Color blocking is taking colors that are opposite on the “color wheel” and pairing them together to make complimentary-ish color combinations. 
                Taking the idea of mixing and matching, more so mixing and less so matching is where this trend comes in. The clothing articles are each made up 
                of only one or two colors and through color blocked pairing an aesthetically pleasing outfit is can be achieved. As a recurring trend in both men’s 
                and women’s fashion in 2017 and 2018, here are some rules to go by when achieving this trend:</p>
            <h3> PRINTS ARE NO GOOD </h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This trend gets by without any help of prints and utilizes solids to their full advantage. Pure color is used to get this outfit to work, 
                so say “no” to patterns. </p>
            <h3> NEUTRALS NEUTRALS NEUTRALS</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This trend does well with combining bright colors with muted neutral colors so as to make the outfit look cohesive and less ridiculous. 
                Blacks, greys, whites, navy blues, and browns work well when combined with brights like orange, yellow, red, and green. 
            <h3> NOT TOO MANY COLORS</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A fast color blocking rule is to choose mainly two or three colors at most in a single outfit. One too many color’s and this ensemble 
                will go south pretty quickly. 
            <h3> KNOW YOUR COLOR WHEEL</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Terms to know: Complementary, Triad, and Analogous. These color concepts will be an important guide in navigating colors if the “bright 
                neutral thing” is getting old. Complements are two colors that are opposite one another on the wheel. Triads are three colors that are 
                each four spaces apart. Analogous shades are all beside one another. 
            <h3> ACCESSORIES MATTER</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It's more than just pants and shirts. Accessories like shoelaces, belts, socks, bags, etc. can be used in any combination with color 
                blocking fashion trends like matching your socks to your shirt and your pants to your shoelaces. Mix-it-up with these accessories to 
                take the trend to a whole new level.</p>
