            <p align="justify"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The weather is about to warm up on campus. Typically, it means more people and less clothes. 
                Unfortunately, warm weather seems put wild frat boys into heat, drawing them out of their houses and toward the cornholes.<br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHow can we spot them? Theyre acutualy easy to notice from afar, as they congregate in large herds. Their hives are 
                usually busy this time of year, with Greek Row being one of the hottest spots. Passing by on 34th Street, ladies risk the high chance of 
                being cat-called, or worse for males: getting recruited. Its wise to have your wits about you this time of year.  <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp They like to wear pastel colors. I think it was in 2009 where it was edgy to wear bright
                colors like pink. In todays day and age, any shirts that are intentionally a size too small is likely worn by a frat man. <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo I get it, now youre wondering if its possible to be in a frat without looking like a tool. The simple answer is yes. 
                Obviously, avoid boat shoes at all costs. Especially if you dont plan to wear socks. Especially more if you plan to wear ankle-high athletic 
                white socks. Go get a shirt that fits without revealing your nipples, and have it be in a color you actually like on yourself. Dont turn your 
                hat backwards for the look of it, and buy some sunglasses that arent the most popular Ray-Bans. <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Do your best to keep your sexual harassment of others to a minimum. I know it can be hard when present in the herd. Focus 
                on your studies rather than getting underage girls wasted and call your mom once in a while.
