            <p align="justify"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Welcome to Drexel University, where everyone cuffs their slacks. 
                Wait, everyone? Take a moment to look around at the people outside. Even in a nor’easter, you’ll find 
                plenty of students sporting cuffed pant-legs. Students at Westphal are the most notorious perpetrators. 
                You know who we’re talking about: The Design and Merchandizing girls, the Music Industry hipsters, and 
                even the Digital Media dorks. What is the origin of this trend, and what does it try to accomplish?<br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou’ve surely seen the “listens to Mac Demarco once” memes all over social. Besides the flat brim dad caps, 
                the ragged red Vans, and the Viceroy cigarettes, are the cuffed pant bottoms. The indie-rock scene is a major 
                driver for the pant cuff phenomenon. Mac Demarco is an obvious example, but many others helped establish 
                the bum chic style. Our ex-peer Gus Daperton looks like he lives in a thrift store. Tyler the Creator and 
                the rest of Odd Future wear floods. Tame Impala’s members wear ratty denim and tee shirts. Young people 
                around the United States are imitating this bum chic style. Maybe today it’s attractive to dress like a 
                musician, even if you’re not. This may be similar to how before 2010, it was attractive to dress like a 
                skater, even if you weren’t.<br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A primary motivation seems to be exposing the ankles. For whatever reason, fashion-forward folk are showing 
                off their lower legs. My mother used to freak out when my pants would flood, but these days, people 
                intentionally purchase short pants. Pants potentially hide high-top shoes, like the oh-so-popular Converse 
                sneakers. Bigger than the shoes, though, are the socks. When Jerry Trainer showed off his LED socks as 
                Spencer on the prolific show iCarly, wacky socks broke into the fashion world. Silly stockings were the 
                death of the ankle-high black Nike swoop socks. They’re so popular in formal wear, Men’s Wearhouse carries 
                a line of colorful socks in store. There’s no denying that this trend is just responding to the much bigger 
                sock-based one.<br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere’s a new concept of streetwear that praises the ankles. On the streetwear subreddit, most pictures 
                include pants that grip tightly to the ankle. It seems to me that the ideal shape is one where the legs 
                progressively get smaller toward the feet. This might have been Japanese influenced, but I think it stems 
                from our repulsion to early 2000’s baggy jeans. <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Over recent years, thrift stores have risen to the top of the fashion food chain. Not only is thrifting a 
                damn good time, vintage clothing is in no short supply. Popular media like “Stranger Things” and “It” are 
                dragging us back to the 80s. Vintage jeans are a treasure to many, but often don’t fit the finder. To 
                remedy this, cuffs go a long way. It’s not rare that someone would be walking out of Philly AIDS Thrift in 
                creased corduroy.<br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs a male at Drexel University, is it cool to follow the trend and cuff your pants? I remember teasing a 
                kid that I met freshman year because of his pants. I referred to him only as “Pant Cuffs,” but now there’s 
                a pair of jeans in my drawer that I literally ironed the cuff into. I really think there’s no harm in 
                following this trend, especially for how practical it is when it comes to getting a decent fit. Pants too 
                long? Cuff them so they’re not so long. Pants too short? Cuff them so it looks like they’re intentionally 
                short. I can kind of see this trend lasting a while because of its practicality, so I don’t blame you if 
                you bend over for it like I did.
