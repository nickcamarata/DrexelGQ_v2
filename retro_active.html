            <p align="justify"> Sportswear meets serious menswear for top trends in 2017 and 2018 men’s fashion. 
                Synonymous with this trend is “athleisure.” It's been the hype for some years now, but this new take 
                is outdated sportswear brands reinvented with logos, colors, cuts, shapes, and silhouettes. We’re 
                seeing brands like Adidas, Fila, Reebok, Champion, and Tommy Hilfiger come full circle revisiting their 
                80’s and 90’s vibes. Think matching tracksuits, vintage sneakers, baseball jackets, vintage jerseys, 
                nylon jumpers, and drawstring trousers in various luxury style fabrics. So what are some staples of 
                this trend and where did they come from? Here’s a little background of its history:</p>
            <h3> FOOTWEAR </h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Today’s sporty, amped-up sneakers get much of their influence 
                from classic sneaker brands like Adidas and Nike as well as from footwear brands like Fila and 
                Reebok that offered vintage trainers with classic silhouettes for years. These styles have now 
                traded up and are coming back in full swing, being revamped with added edge in the color, shape, 
                and textiles.</p>
            <h3>The 80s</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The 80’s had the “shell suit,” the matching two piece zipper 
                tracksuit, and it was all anyone wanted in the 80’s when it came to looking “dope”. Hip-hop was 
                on the rise and these pieces went hand in hand with rap groups and stars of the day. The hip-hop 
                group, Run-DMC, iconically wore this look and young people took this trend by storm mix-matching 
                colors, patterns, and styles. This style is coming back little by little.
            <h3> The 90s</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 90’s rave culture was truly the rave and inspired baggier 
                and brighter oversized fits in almost all areas of fashion. Wearing XXL only was the rule. 
                Inspired by techno raves and acid houses, this party culture took fashion by storm with brands 
                like Champion and Fila pioneering the trend in sweatshirts, jackets, and pants. </p>
            <h3> RETRO SPORTSWEAR T-SHIRTS</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Vintage football jerseys, hockey jerseys and basically all 
                jerseys are making a real comeback. Real vintage limited edition jerseys from the 70’s, 80’s, 
                and 90’s are being worn as fashion today and are being auctioned at very high prices. These 
                nitty-gritty one-of-a-kind jersey styles are being appropriated in fashion through jersey 
                style t-shirts with sports inspired colors, patterns, emblems, and numbers. 
            <h3> TRACKSUITS</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The tracksuit, is noticeably one of the most iconic sportswear 
                staples. Not only is it engrained in popular culture, but also fashion. Originally the tracksuit 
                was intended from athletic use with its nylon shiny material and loose fitting. Worn by music and 
                style icons like Eminem and Drake, the tracksuit has made its name fashion. Even high fashion 
                designers like Balenciaga have even created collections with oversized silhouettes and quirky 
                looks inspired by the original piece.<br> <br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo why is this trend so prevalent today? Sportswear very much has found its way into 
                the fashion world for decades now representing core values in fashion like on-the-go comfort, 
                authenticity, high quality, and timeless style with an edge. Athletic culture is only growing 
                and has now engrained itself in fashion with people wanting to look and feel the part while 
                also representing a sporty chic ambiance. High fashion brands are reinventing the style as 
                well transforming the vintage pieces into extremely coveted clothing. 
            </p>
            <h3> BOTTOM LINE</h3>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sportswear is on the rise and is here to stay.</p>
