            <p align="justify">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA staple of today’s typical men’s suit, the neck-tie has remained throughout history as a 
                necessity to a working man’s uniform and can make or break the entire ensemble. Loose and hanging, the 
                business man is off duty; sharp and tight, he is ready for the job. <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd it’s not just today. The immortal fashion piece has showed up in history time and time again. 
                While it may have changed over time, the simple neck piece is rarely ever not seen on an important 
                man in history. Reaching as far back as 17th century France, and populated by monarchs, la cravate 
                made its debut. As they were, you may not recognize this dated fashion piece now as even the last 
                hundred years has altered the tie entirely.<br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe beginning of the 20th century gave the cravat a new spin by introducing a new knot and a growth 
                in popularity of the ascot. Not until the second decade did we see a similar looking necktie to the 
                ones worn today, keeping bowties in a more formal realm. This opened the doors to adding new spins on 
                the tie. Every decade brought on its own spin of the necktie; widths, shapes, lengths, colors, and 
                even fabrics all changed over time. Through this, men are still today able to express more of their 
                personalities and fashion sense through their neckwear. <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOf course, this then begs the questions, “Well, thick or thin?” And while I wish I could give a 
                straight answer, it’s a little bit more complicated. Menswear has become more and more restricted, 
                especially within the last century. I am a strong believer in personal expression, men often find 
                comfort in the modern day classics of an ensemble. While this can limit creativity, it leaves an 
                incredible opportunity to show off through accessorizing. <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt has been debated, decided on, and then changed over and over again that the tie should look a 
                certain way. It is important to recognize this and then, to be frank, completely ignore it. This, 
                of course, as long as you completely overlook the brief blip in fashion history of most of the 70’s 
                and 80’s. So how should ties be worn?<br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is first important to understand which ties are which. For the purpose of this article we are 
                going to skip over the bolo tie and hope that, in this day and age, no one will be pursuing it as an 
                option for any public appearance. The most common tie is the standard tie with a length of about 
                3.25-3.5 inches. Typically, these ties are great for suits and normal, day to day wear in the office. 
                While it may seem that at work there are few options to jazz up an outfit, the tie is a perfect 
                opportunity. There are many designs to spruce up a suit, but it is important to keep in mind that, 
                yes, colors and patterns can clash. I recommend for the newly fashion conscious to wear a single 
                colored suit with a dark colored pattern. Avoid wearing too much of the same color. A blue suit is 
                combinable with possibly a white top and a red patterned tie. Black suits can offer more options. 
                Feeling adventurous? Try wearing a black or grey suit with a bright color like purple. It can make 
                an outfit much more interesting and will show off confidence to others. <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNext is the skinny at a length of about 1.5-2 inches. This tie can seem more casual and cool and many 
                times are worn without a jacket. This may be worn for a night out on the town or a dinner date. These 
                ties, because of their lack of surface area, can have a great impact with an inverted effect. Try a 
                bright or patterned top with a solid, dark skinny tie. Skinny ties are also great for adding length to 
                a torso. Because it is really just a thin line on the body, this tie can elongate a man’s appearance, 
                which is beneficial for shorter men. This is also a good option for men that are thinner or have 
                shoulders that aren’t too broad. There will be less of a visual competition between the tie and the body. <br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThirdly, is the narrow tie. In between the standard and skinny tie, the narrow sits at about 2.75-3 
                inches in length. This is a perfect option for men with less athletic body types, but aren’t feeling 
                the hipster vibe with the skinny tie. Again, this thinner length gives the body a larger appearance. 
                Because it is the middle ground, this tie is the perfect option for a day to night look. Mix and match 
                patterns and styles for a more fun and modern look.<br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It may be surprising that a simple tie can change so much in an appearance, but it is a great tool to 
                take advantage of. With over 300 years under its belt, the necktie will never go out of fashion.<br><br>
